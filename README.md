# Oroo_nights_soundscape
A layered, immersive nocturnal soundscape exploring tension, ritual, and ancestral presence. Designed for interactive web playback with Tone.js, this project models the progression of a sacred night through five audio layers — from exterior ambience to intimate interior spaces, natural warnings, the main procession, and optional narration.
